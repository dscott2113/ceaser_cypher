# ceaser_cypher
Ceaser Cyper script I built when learning how encryption works and also was just getting into python. 

Main Ceaser is a bit more complex. Allow you to use a passphrase as the encryption method and it also allows for decryption of a message you have encrpyted if you use the same passphrase.
