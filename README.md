## Ceaser Cipher
		I began this project as my very first python experience. While I learned a ton and really enjoyed
	learning not only about python but also the basic concept of how encyption works and the use of cypher
	text. I did this project a few months back and don't have great updates form the process or much to add
	to a write up on it from the process of working on it. I did learn a lot about variables, user input, how
	important where code is at matters, and alot of just the basics of how python works. I think my favorite
	part of this project was getting it to work with a passphrase as the shift key instead of numbers for the 
	"ecnryption" part as most examples and tutorials I saw only used simple numbers. So I was proud of being 
	able to implement this part bascially on my own by thinking about how the script was working for other
	parts and just reverse engineering it for what I wanted so to speak. 

		The simple_ceaser version is much like most simple projects people have videos on when you search
	youtube so I wanted to do something different with the second version the "main_ceaser" and added the 
	passphrase and decryption part.
